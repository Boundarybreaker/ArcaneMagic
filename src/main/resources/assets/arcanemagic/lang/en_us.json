  "parchment.arcanemagic.drowned_discovery": "I am writing this to record an unusual species which I discovered whilst swimming today. It featured many of the same properties as the Zombies I have seen countless times before, but it was blue and thrived underwater. When I killed it, the particles released looked very different to anything I am used to. I will try and kill more of them when I get the chance in order to learn about the species. I will try to document my findings after four kills."
