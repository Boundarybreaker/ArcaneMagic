  "parchment.arcanemagic.drowned_discovery_1": "I am writing this to record an unusual species which I discovered whilst swimming today. It featured many of the same properties as the Zombies I have seen countless times before, but it was blue and thrived underwater. When I killed it, the particles released looked very different to anything I am used to. In order to study this further I will need to kill more of them and document my findings once I reach a conclusion.",
  "parchment.arcanemagic.drowned_discovery_2": "Since my last entry, I have killed several of the drowned zombies, but the particles dissipated before I could study them properly. I theorize that killing them whilst they stand on a sufficiently dense object such as this altar I have designed may stabilize the particles, at least temporarily."
