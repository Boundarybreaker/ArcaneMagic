It featured many of the same properties as the Zombies I have seen countless times before, but it was blue and thrived underwater. This change seems to have happened unnaturally fast, and I should like to find out why. Since I don't know enough about the zombies to come to a conclusion at this point, I will try and find some more to kill before writing an update.",
  "parchment.arcanemagic.discovery.gather_new": "After killing several more underwater zombies, I am beginning to realize that they are not the only anomaly - in fact, so much of the world I knew is changing. The zombies that I have been analyzing share their home with fish, dolphins and various plants that I have never seen before - even the trees and flowers on the surface look different. It might be easier to examine the changes if I gathered some of the new items."
