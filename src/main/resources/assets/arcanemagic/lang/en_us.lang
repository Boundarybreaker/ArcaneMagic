# Message
desc.arcanemagic.ancient_parchment=Rare drop from witches. Shift+right-click bedrock while holding to use.
arcanemagic.message.cantlearn=Nothing new can be learned from this
arcanemagic.message.ancient_parchment=Ancient Secrets
arcanemagic.message.ancient_parchment.0=The arcane magicians have left several clues, but I cannot piece together what they want.
arcanemagic.message.ancient_parchment.1=Their parchments do seem to attract an odd variety of dust particles when deep in the world however. Soon I will try placing the parchment on the bedrock itself, but I am afraid of losing it.
arcanemagic.message.parchment.redstone=Stored Energy
arcanemagic.message.parchment.redstone.0=The way redstone is able to absorb energy for release at a later time is incredible. You believe it may use similar mechanics to the Analyzer, which releases the knowledge stored in items.
arcanemagic.message.parchment.redstone.1=If you knew which items had this energy inside them, it would make it much easier to use the analyzer. Perhaps some device can be consturcted using the properties of redstone?

# Notebook
arcanemagic.notebook.category.unknown_realms=Unknown Realms
arcanemagic.notebook.category.unknown_realms.0=It seems impossible that this notebook could exist. You never witnessed it's creation, or understand why it is so empty.
arcanemagic.notebook.category.unknown_realms.1=It is possible that you were given this by someone else, and in that case it would seem wise to throw it away, as if you wanted to obtain a similar book of your own it would likely be possible without the help of others.
arcanemagic.notebook.category.unknown_realms.2=If you wanted to keep this, you would have to at least understand it's origins.
arcanemagic.notebook.category.ancient_relics=Ancient Relics
arcanemagic.notebook.category.ancient_relics.0=It feels almost supernatural how you managed to conjure this book from just a parchment and some bedrock. The witch who was previously carrying the paper clearly had no idea of the power it contained.
arcanemagic.notebook.category.ancient_relics.1=The particles collected when holding a similar parchment while deep underground are very intriguing. They may contain similar properties to those that allowed this book to be formed.
arcanemagic.notebook.category.ancient_relics.2=By studying the notes left here by arcane magicians who passed away long ago, you hope it will be possible to understand this form of magic better, and perhaps even use it to your advantage.
arcanemagic.notebook.category.forgotten_knowledge=Forgotten Knowledge
arcanemagic.notebook.category.forgotten_knowledge.0=Unfortunately, it appears that the rest of this book is missing. After witnessing the Ancient Parchment's reaction with the particles, you believe it may be possible for other things to react in similar ways. Perhaps making some device to analyze them closely would help?
arcanemagic.notebook.category.forgotten_knowledge.1=You wonder why the pages are missing, however. Hopefully this will become evident eventually.
arcanemagic.notebook.category.arcane_analysis=Arcane Analysis
arcanemagic.notebook.category.arcane_analysis.0=Your theory was correct! With the Analyzer you have made, it appears possible to unveil hidden knowledge within everyday items. When certain objects are placed on the device, it emits purple particles which seem to indicate the presense of said knowledge.
arcanemagic.notebook.category.arcane_analysis.1=If there was a way to extract the knowledge from the items, back into your notebook, it would surely be a huge step forwards - you have noticed that when placing paper into the Analyzer, an interesting reaction takes place. Paper can be inserted only when another item is already present, and, once inside, levitates above the block itself, attracting light beams which help to illuminate the page.
arcanemagic.notebook.category.arcane_analysis.2=However, the paper is sometimes surrounded by red light, indicating an inadequate environment for analyzation. Perhaps trying to use the paper on an item that contains magical properties, while deep in the world, would prove useful?
arcanemagic.notebook.category.arcane_analysis.3=This does seem to be the case. Now, you only need to decide what is worthy of investigation in your analyzer. Since Redstone shares similar energy storage properties with the mystical particles you have witnessed many times before, it may be a good candidate for this experiment.
arcanemagic.notebook.category.magical_insights=Magical Insights
arcanemagic.notebook.category.magical_insights.0=Analyzing redstone has given you a great insight into the mechanics behind Energy Storage. Since you believe your Analyzer to work in a similar way, you have designed an item capable of detecting unknown knowledge present in the world.
arcanemagic.notebook.category.magical_insights.1=When the newly constructed Illuminator is held, particles seem to drift into any blocks that contain important knowledge. 
arcanemagic.notebook.category.magical_insights.2=This gives you a huge advantage when trying to determine what to analyze next, as it should be easily visible simply by traveling throughout the world while holding the item.
arcanemagic.notebook.category.essence_collection=Essence Collection
arcanemagic.notebook.category.essence_collection.0=
arcanemagic.notebook.category.essence_collection.1=
arcanemagic.notebook.category.essence_collection.2=
arcanemagic.notebook.category.crystallization=Crystallization
arcanemagic.notebook.category.crystallization.0=Through your journeys thus far, you have discovered light particles imbued with what appears to be some form of magic. Now that you have learned more about the behaviour of this energy, perhaps it might be time to try manipulating it to your advantage.
arcanemagic.notebook.category.crystallization.1=An Essence Crystallizer appears to do exactly what you want. Perhaps placing one near the particles you found might prove useful?
